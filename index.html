          <h3>What's so important about Evo?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Everyone has their own hobbies and personal interest. Video games are
          a very popular one and the fighting game genre, specifically, is one
          of the reasons why games are so popular today. At Evo, the entire
          community comes out to celebrate the genre and what is has meant to
          them each indivdually. This year, Evo reached 10,240 indivdual
          entrants for all of it's games. That's an 11.52% increase from the
          previous year and it is bound to keep growing. Not only that but
          players from around the world join in on the games, with 64 different
          countries signing up to attend.

          Not only do people come out to Evo for cash rewards and bragging
          rights, but they also come for Evo itself. The Tournament has become
          more than just that but also a convention of everything fighting
          games. Game Studios come through to show what their development teams
          are cooking up, museums are setup to show the history of fighting (the
          arcadestick museum was the best), entrants can cosplay as their
          favorite characters, tons of vendors to purchase merch from titles
          that are loved, and more. It's become not only a tournament, but a
          convention.

          <h3>Why Evo?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          I have been playing fighting games since 2014, so it's been 10 years
          at this point that I have been apart of this community. If I am being
          honest, I have never been to Evo. However, it's been a dream of mine.
          I've watched it every year on Twitch and even once on ESPN (that was
          crazy to see). And even then, I never fail to become emotional
          watching this thing. I don't want to go pro at video games, I don't
          want to cash rewards or anything like that. I just want to celebrate
          something that has kept me going ever since I was a lost high school
          kid. Also, this thing went from supporting itself to being sponsored
          by Chipotle! I got three free burritos!
